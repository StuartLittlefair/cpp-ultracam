1) Test whether it would not be better to constrain the beta parameter
   of moffat fits

2) Put in a corrector for the August 2004 timing drift problem.

3) Stop reduce rejigging apertures that will not be extracted

4) See if the slide can be controlled from udriver.

5) What is problem with flat-field if any?

6) FWHM fitting for small values of FWHM

7) Write program to compute gain of L3CCD
