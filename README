'ultracam' is a set of software for the reduction of ULTRACAM and ULTRASPEC
data. It is often referred to as the 'ultracam pipeline'.

Installation order: subs --> colly --> ultracam

See www.astro.warwick.ac.uk/people/marsh/software for further info.

NB There are some scripts which although released in the pipeline are intended
more for me (TRM) than anyone else and require extra bits of software to
run. 'procbias' is probably the best example as it needs bit and pieces of my
Python programs as well as SExtractor, but few others should want to use it.
Some others are more useful, in particular 'ulog2fits' for which you will need
Python along with 3rd-party modules numpy and pyfits. I don't have configure 
check for these so that people can get up and running reasonably quickly. 

Installation
------------

Main installation notes are in 'INSTALL'. If installing for the first time,
run './bootstrap' before anything else which tries to get the autotools 
stuff configured.
