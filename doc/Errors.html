<h1>ULTRACAM software errors</h1>

<p>
You are likely to encounter a number of rather obscure looking error messages while
running the Ultracam software. The ones I know about are not software errors so much
as incorrect inputs, although I am sure there are software errors too. The software
tries not to impose more limits than need be, but sometimes has to give up because of
incompatible input frames etc. I hope in this file to list some of the more common ones
and provide a fuller explanation. It is not possible for the software itself to do this
in anything but a fairly generic manner without a great deal more effort from me, which
I don't think is warranted.

<p>
This page is more for general users' benefit than my own, so please send me any faults
which you don't understand and I will put them here.

<h2>Error cropping frames</h2>

<p>
<a href="reduce.html">reduce</a> will sometimes stop immediately with an error such as
<pre>
Processing frame number 1, time = 19 Sep 2002, 20:37:08.19754

Ultracam::Ultracam_Error:
Ref window 1
No enclosing window in void CCD<Windata>::crop(const CCD<Window>& win)
</pre>

<p>
If this happen take a look with <a href="uinfo,html">uinfo</a> at the frame 
formats of the input data (you may have to grab one for this), and the calibration 
frames. It needs the data frame windows to be fully inside the calibration frame windows.
The first step on reading a data frame is to crop the windows of the calibration frames 
down to match those of the data. If it can't do this it gives up with this message.
