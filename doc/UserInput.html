<h1>User input to the ULTRACAM pipeline software</h1>

<p>
User input to the programs is via the command line and/or prompts. I have
designed it to be similar in flavour to the ADAM parameter system used
in STARLINK code (e.g. KAPPA, FIGARO etc), although the implementation is pure 
C++ and there are some differences. It has some features that the Starlink input
doesn't have, and vice versa, there are some which Starlink has but this does not.
    
<p>
For example, you can invoke a program just by typing its name, e.g. 'sub'. You
will not get a standard UNIX style 'usage: ...' message, but you will instead be
prompted for the first argument, then the second, etc. This is helpful when first
using a program, but can get irritating as you rise to guru status, so you can instead type 
the whole lot on the command line, e.g. 
<p>
<pre>
sub run003 bias run003
</pre>

<p>
In this case the program identifies the arguments by position, but if you are not
sure of the positions, you can name some or all of them as follows:
<p>
<pre>
sub run003 input2=bias output=run003
</pre>
or perhaps as
<pre>
sub run003 output=run003 input2=bias
</pre>
because the order of named parameters does not matter. You name as few or as many of the parameters as you
like; you will be prompted for any that you do not name.

<p>
If you want to specify a parameter with a space such as title="A plot", you should enclose
the string in quotes.


<h3>Default flag</h3>

<p>
The default is '\' which you need to type as '\\' on the UNIX command line because
of the special meaning of '\'. The default flag means "assume the default for this
parameter and any others not explicitly specified". Thus
<p>
<strong>sub \\ input2=bias </strong>
<p>
takes default values for the first and third parameters, but explicitly sets the second.

<p>
<h3>Default saving</h3>

<p>
An important feature of the input system is that at the end of the program, whatever
values you have input are saved as defaults for the next time in special files. This
can save a great deal of typing. Some are kept as 'global' defaults that apply to all
programs which use the same input name. Others are 'local' and apply to the particular
program in question and none other. You do not need to know which is which, but knowing
this should let you know why some defaults change and others don't. To avoid simultaneous
implemetations of the software from interfering, you can re-direct the standard directory
for storage of the defaults by setting the environment variable <strong>ULTRACAM_ENV</strong>
to point somewhere else. Sometimes everything may get horribly corrupted (e.g. you manage
to hit ctrl-C just as the default files are being written), in which case
you might want to delete the default files and start from scratch. You will either find
them in the directory pointed at by ULTRACAM_DIR, or, if this is not set, in $HOME/.ultracam.
An alternative which may be more convenient is to specify <strong>nodefs</strong> on the command 
line which ensures that no attempt to access the default files will be made at all. This is 
very useful in batch processing where one typically specifies all arguments on the command line and might
want to run multiple non-interfering jobs at the same time. Of course in this case, you do not
get defaults set from previous runs of the command but just the initial "first time" defaults that
the programm themselves generate, and so you may need to set many parameters explicitly.

<h3>Prompted vs unprompted inputs</h3>

<p>
Not all inputs are prompted for. In particular parameters that rarely change or have values that 
you would not normally want to alter are often hidden to save lots of unnecessary prompting.
For instance the plot device tends to stay the same most of the time and so is not prompted for 
by default. If you know the name of such a variable (they are listed between square brackets on
the web pages) you can always specify it on the command line by name: 'device=/xs' for example. 
Alternatively, to force all variables to be prompted, specify <strong>prompt</strong> on the command line,
e.g. 'sub prompt'.

<p>
You can also force a program to list all its inputs using the special keyword <strong>list</strong>.

<p>
The special parameters, <strong>list</strong>, <strong>prompt</strong> and <strong>nodefs</strong> can be specified for any
command. Note that unlike ADAM input, other yes/no type variables <strong>cannot be specified just by
their name</strong>. You have to type 'plot=no' for example, not 'noplot'. They are just like
other parameters in fact, except that the only values you can specify are 'y', 'yes', 'true',
or 'n', 'no', 'false'.

<p>
<h3>Range-checking and how to override it</h3>

<p>
Input of floats, doubles, ints etc is always checked against an
allowable range. In some cases this covers the entire possible range
for that data type, but sometimes the range is just set to "reasonable"
values. You can set the value to the ends of the range by typing 'min' or 'max'. Mostly these ranges are
set to prevent silly input, but in some cases they are for
convenience, in particular for the plot limits which by default just
cover the full CCD. You may have a reason for wanting to override the
range-checking, which you can do by starting your input with '>>'. So
'>>-100' could set the left plot limit to -100 even though the minimum
value was in fact set to 0.5. A '?' for one of these parameters will
produce a print out of the allowable range if you are struggling. If
you enter a value out-of-range without the forcing flag '>>', the program will be aborted.

<p>
The one other data type that is checked as character data as in single letters,
which are compared against a list of possibilities. The allowed values can be listed
by typing '?'. In most cases you will see letters repeated in lower and upper-case;
this is to give case insensitive testing while allowing for case-sensitivity in
general.

<p>
<h3>Listing the defaults</h3>

<p>
The command <a href="vshow.html">vshow</a> can be used to show what the current defaults
are for a command, or globally if you sepcify the file GLOBAL. This may be useful on
occasion if you are struggling to work out what is happening.

<p>
<h3>Using variables set in one program as the input for another</h3>

<p>
There is potential to save values computed in one program and retrieve them
in another. This uses the global default file. Let's say one routine saves a value
to a variable call 'mean_value'. Then a command such as 
<pre>
cdiv image @mean_value image
</pre>
will divide image by that value. Starlink afficianados will recognize this as 
a slightly less flexible version of the Starlink equivalent. Nevertheless it 
could be useful. 

<p>
<h3>Running ultracam in batch</h3>

The ultracam pipeline commands can be run in batch like any other commands. 
You do however need to watch out for possible conflicts with interactive sessions of the pipeline or other batch sessions because
there could be problems accessing the default storage files. To avoid this it is sensible in long running scripts
especially to re-define the enviroment variable ULTRACAM_ENV which points to the defualt directory, as in 
<pre>
setenv ULTRACAM_ENV defaults
</pre>
Without this being set, the pipeline uses a standard directory $HOME/.ultracm and multiple sessions could
result in problems.
