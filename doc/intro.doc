#/*! \mainpage ULTRACAM Pipeline Software Version 7.0.6 API Documentation

\section intro Introduction

You have reached the home page of the documentation of ULTRACAM pipeline software Application
Programmer's Interface. Links from here give details of the various classes used by ULTRACAM.
These pages do not describe the executable programs which make up the bulk of the files that
come with the software. If you are a user you may want to <a href="../../index.html">refer to these</a>
instead.
	
\section Overview

The ULTRACAM software is written in C++. The philosophy is to
represent individual components by C++ objects. This leads to a natural
correspondence between the code and reality and makes maintenance of the many
programs easier.

The main classes are as follows. First, there are classes which represent individual
objects that one might find on a CCD such as an \ref Aperture and \ref Target. Next there is a class
called \ref CCD that can bundle these together into a group representing a CCD's worth of such objects.
Finally, a class called \ref MCCD groups several CCD's worth to make a frame's worth, where
a "frame" is an entire ULTRACAM set of 3 CCDs. These classes and the software in general
make extensive use of the Standard Template Library (STL), and so you should be familiar with
this if you want to create your own programs.

Undoubtedly the easiest way to make your own program is to start from an existing one of similar
purpose.
