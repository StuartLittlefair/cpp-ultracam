<h1>ULTRACAM Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p>
If you are puzzled by aspects of the pipeline software, before
asking me, please look here to see if someone else has already asked it
(or whether I have just invented it for that matter ..).

<h2> <a name="help">Help! There are loads of commands. Where do I start?</a></h2>

<p>
The place to start is to look at the brief <a href="GettingStarted.html">getting started</a> guide.
It emphasizes brevity over completeness.

<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="bias">Why when I change the binning on a frame with 'crop'
does the bias level come out wrong?</a></h2>

<p>
The problem here is that the rebinning behaviour of <a href="crop.html">crop</a>
is to sum all of the pixel values that contribute to the new larger pixels (one cannot
go to less binning). This is OK for the true counts but does not apply to the bias
level. In fact one should really take frames of the same format for deducing the
bias correctly. Otherwise dividing by the number of old pixels which contribute to
each new pixel may get you to approximately the right level. This means that if you want to 
bin normal data you <strong>must subtract the bias from it first!!!</strong>

<p>
<hr>
<h2> 
<a name="reference">'reduce' complains that it can't find a "reference aperture". What does it mean?</a>
</h2>

<p>
If you want variable aperture radii and/or optimal extraction, profile fits are needed. In this case
you must specify which targets you want to use to define the profile shapes. The reposition
mode 'reference_plus_tweak' also requires this. This is done in 
<a href="setaper.html">setaper</a>. If you fail to define any such targets for a CCD, 
<a href="reduce.html">reduce</a> will abort with an error message (prior to version 2.3 it 
carried on in normal mode but I realised that this would be misleading).

<p>
<hr>
<h2> 
<a name="optimal">Why are the 'optimal' and 'normal' counts fairly different?</a>
</h2>

<p>
Tim Naylor's optimal photometry only works when you take the ratio of target and comparison.
It would be possible to provide a correct normalisation if the profile fits were an accurate
representation of the profiles. This is not usually the case, although I have tried to apply corrections
on the basis that the profile fits are accurate. Still, its only the ratios that are useful.
<p>

<hr>
<h2> 
<a name="absolute">How can I put optimal counts on a proper magnitude scale then?</a></h2>

<p>
Easy this one: you can't, at least not directly. As said above, optimal counts can only be used
in ratios, but also they can only be used as ratios between <i>two targets on the same frame</i>.
Therefore to put a proper scale on, one should also carry out a normal extraction of the comparison
star you used, do the same for a standard star and use their ratio to provide a correction
to magnitudes.

<hr>
<h2> 
<a name="installation">Everything compiled & installed OK but when I try to run commands, they
complain about not finding libraries ...</a></h2>

<p>
Have you set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable up correctload library path up correctly?
If you don't know what this is about, look again at the installation instructions. You need to
tell the software where to find shareable libraries for PGPLOT and Xerces.

<p>
<hr>
<h2> 
<a name="slalib">I can't find SLALIB anywhere ...</a>
</h2>

<p>
Sorry I can't distribute SLALIB; you must get it from Pat Wallace at RAL. You want the
C version. 

<p>
<hr>
<h2> <a name="combine">When I use 'combine' or 'makeflat' to average a few
frames, they sometimes falls over ...</a></h2>

<p>
This can happen if when you invoked <a href="grab.html">grab</a> to get the
frames you terminated it with ctrl-C. In this case the last frame can be partial
and therefore corrupt. This is typically the case if the last file was not
reported as having been written by <a href="grab.html">grab</a>. If you
inadvertently include such a file in your list for <a
href="combine.html">combine</a> (or other similar routines), then it falls
over. The solution is to delete such corrupt files.

<p>
<hr>
<h2> <a name="batch">Can I run two or more sessions of the software at the same time?</a></h2>

<p>
The answer is yes, but you have to be careful. The reason why it can be difficult is that
each session may access the same default files which could cause disaster if you are relying
on the defaults. One way is to specify 'nodefs' which at least stops the programs accessing
the default files. You would then need to specify all arguments yourself if the default
defaults are no good. However, much the best solution is to specify the environment variable
ULTRACAM_ENV to point at a new location for storing the defaults, as in
<pre>
setenv ULTRACAM_ENV defaults
</pre>
Then assuming you are operating in different directories you will be OK. I do this for my
batch jobs, leaving the interactive one in the standard location.

<p>
<hr>
<h2> <a name="stats">I don't understand the windows files needed by the stats
command ...</a></h2>

<p>
<a href="stats.html">stats</a> gives you statistics of all pixels of a frame
'visible' through a set of windows defined in a separate file. You should
imagine placing a flat mask on top of your frame with holes cut out of it
corresponding to the windows of the windows file. This means that the binning
factors of the windows frame are <i>irrelevant</i>. Then why are they needed
at all? This is laziness .. I did not want to define another type of window.
You should always use binning factors = 1 in the statistics windows file.
This file is best defined using <a href="setwin.html">setwin</a>.

<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="bad_pixel">If I try using a bad pixel file, every sky pixel gets
kicked out. What is going on?</a></h2>

<p>
I am not quite sure yet whether this is a bug or not. The key thing to realise
is that any pixels in the bad pixel frame with a value above 0.5 counts as
bad. In other words 0 = good. At least one instance of this problem was because
all good pixels were being set = 1.

<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="binning">Cannot subtract frames even when coerce=yes; what does llx=0 mean?</a></h2>

<p>
A couple of people have found that they cannot apply full-frame, unbinned 
calibration frames to their data. This should not be the case. Unfortunately
this is the result of a fix for a problem I only spotted in January 2006. Essentially
it seems that with binned data, the windows do not start at the expected X positions,
but effectively seem to move out by 1 pixel (at least in xbin=2 binning). If the windows
are at the edge, then they move out of the range even of full-frame images causing 'sub',
'msub' etc to fail. The fix is to trim off the pixels at the left and right edges either
using 'crop', or easier by using the trim option in 'grab', 'rtplot' and 'reduce'.

<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="unsigned">I get an error like "Cannot retrieve an unsigned int from int-type header items"?</a></h2>

If you can the following error, or something like it:
<pre>
Subs::Subs_Error exception:
Cannot retrieve an unsigned int from int-type header items
</pre>
you could be suffering from a simple problem caused by an upgrade when I have
changed the internal data type of one of the parameters. The program then
encounters
a problem when reading an old file of defaults. The cure is easy. You simply
delete the corresponding default file (and potentially the global defaults
file). e.g. if using <a href="msub.html">msub</a> then delete
~/.ultracam/msub.def assuming that the default file is in the default location,
or else $ULTRACAM_ENV/msub.def, and possibly also GLOBAL.def in the same directory.
