<h1>Getting started with the ULTRACAM pipeline software</h1>

<p>
This page attempts to give you an idea of how to get going with the software,
without going into extensive details. Follow the links for further information;
see towards the end for a bit on spectra.

<p>
Let's suppose that you are observing, or that you have come back with data from a run.
Your data will consist of pairs of files of the form 'run012.xml' and 
'run012.dat'. The XML file is an ASCII file which describes the format
of the data in a fairly obvious html-ish way. The '.dat' file contains raw binary data 
plus times stored during a complete ULTRACAM run. These store all the data from, say, 45 minutes of 1 second
exposures. These files can be large.  Here is how you might go about dealing with this data.

<p>
<table>

<tr valign="top">
<td><strong>1</strong></td>
<td width=20%><strong>Firing up the software</strong></td>
<td>First of all you need to to define the aliases for the ULTRACAM programs. This requires
sourcing a script file called Ultracam that should be located in the top-level of the installed
distribution. It is well worth defining an alias e.g. 'ultracam' to carry this
out for you as in
<pre>
alias ultracam 'source $TRM_SOFTWARE/bin/ultracam/Ultracam'
</pre>
which you can stick in your '.cshrc' or equivalent.
In addition, if you are accessing the data at the telescope, you need to start the ATC FileServer 
which dishes out the raw data to the pipeline across a network via http requests; this is independent 
of the pipeline software. If you have the raw data on a local disk, you will not need it.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td><strong>2</strong></td> <td><strong>What do my data look like?</strong></td> 
<td>Typically you first want to plot the data. The program you want is <a href="rtplot.html">rtplot</a> which will allow
you to plot data even as it accumulates into the .dat file. It accesses the 
large data files and plots images sequentially. It also contains facilities for setting
up your windows, avoiding CCD defects and for fitting profiles to stars which is
useful when focussing. Useful tip: a backslash is response to any input means
  assume default values for all following arguments, see
  the <a href="UserInput.html">user input guide</a>.
</td></tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td><strong>3</strong></td> <td><strong>Setting up windows (observing only)
</strong></td> <td><a href="rtplot.html">rtplot</a> has an option to load an
ASCII file defining the windows which it plots over the data.
As each new frame comes in it re-reads the file so you can adjust 
it by editing the file. The idea is to run in a heavily binned (4 by 4) fast acquisition mode and ask
the TO to move the telescope and/or rotator until your field is where you want it. You
must always save the window setup file to disk for it to be re-loaded by <a href="rtplot.html">rtplot</a>.
Beware CCD defects! You need to look at all 3 CCDs to ensure that you are not
affected by any. <a href="rtplot.html">rtplot</a> now includes the option of
accessing windows contained by a Java-based program called Udriver which can act
as a server.
</td></tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td><strong>4</strong></td> <td><strong>Grabbing frames</strong></td>
<td><a href="rtplot.html">rtplot</a> is very much a first look. To do
more you may want to grab individual exposures and save them to the
pipeline's native format, ".ucm" files. The program you want is <a
href="grab.html">grab</a>.  This spits out one file per exposure,
which could amount to hundreds or thousands for a single run so very often
you may want to ctrl-C it. For
example, this is useful if you want to apply bias subtraction in <a
href="rtplot.html">rtplot</a>. First grab a bias run, then combine the
resulting files with <a href="combine.html">combine</a> (see
  also <a href="makebias.html">makebias</a>). 
Incidentally,
if you do ctrl-C during <a href="grab.html">grab</a>, you may want to
delete the last file which may be corrupted (typically it is corrupted
if <a href="grab.html">grab</a> did not report that it was written to disk
and yet it exists). Once you have data in native form, a suite of standard
programs can be run on them. Alternatively you may prefer to operate with 
a reduction code of your choice, in which case you can save to FITS files using 
<a href="grab2fits.html">grab2fits</a>. This is certainly useful if you
want access to good image display programs such as 'ds9' and 'gaia' because 
the pipeline does not attempt to replicate the features of such programs,
 and has just a couple of simple display programs <a href="plot.html">plot</a>
and <a href="cplot.html">cplot</a>.

</td></tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td><strong>5</strong></td> <td><strong>Getting a light
curve</strong></td> <td>Next you may want to see a light curve of some
sort. The program <a href="reduce.html">reduce</a> is what you
want. This can run off the large raw files, or sequences of files as
produced by <a href="grab.html">grab</a>.  I normally run off the raw
files, but you will in any case need to grab some of the data
initially in order to set up apertures with <a
href="setaper.html">setaper</a>. <a href="reduce.html">reduce</a> is
mainly controlled by an <a href="reduce.red">input ASCII file</a> which 
you can (and should) edit with normal text editors. <a href="reduce.html">reduce</a> 
saves its results to an ASCII file which is the key product of the software.
Once you have set up the apertures and edited the control file, you can run
reduce. You will be able to determine whether you want to plot images and/or
the light curve at the time you invoke reduce.
</td></tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td><strong>6</strong></td> 
<td><strong>Going further with your data</strong></td>
<td>The light-curve files are ASCII files with one line per CCD and a 
set of instructions at the top detailing their contents. Any standard package should 
be able to read these files and make suitable plots. However note that you may want to re-do all the reduction
at the end of a run with the two-pass mode of <a href="reduce.html">reduce</a> which has certain
advantages. The ASCII files are somewhat unwieldy and if you are happy with the
  idea of reading in FITS rather than ASCII files, I suggest converting them
to FITS using <a href="ulog2fits.html">ulog2fits</a> for which you must have
  Python along with the 3rd-party modules numpy and pyfits. 'fv' is a
  convenient routine to examine the FITS file output by this script.
</td></tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td><strong>7</strong></td> 
<td><strong>Extra</strong></td> 
<td>There are a fair number of helper scripts around including ones
  for <a href="debias.html">debiassing</a>,
  for <a href="makebias.html">making biases</a> and many others.</td></tr>

<h2>Spectra</h2>

<p>
If you have spectra to reduce then there are some other routines that you may
want to use.

<table>

<tr valign="top">
<td><strong>1</strong></td> <td><strong>Profiles</strong></td> 
<td>With spectra one often wants to looks at cuts through the data. The commands
to do this are <a href="collapse.html">collapse</a> and <a
href="lplot.html">lplot</a>.</td></tr>  

<tr valign="top">
<td><strong>2</strong></td> <td><strong>Defining apertures</strong></td> 
<td>To define extraction and sky regions, use the command <a
href="setreg.html">setreg</a>.
</td></tr>  

<tr valign="top">
<td><strong>3</strong></td> <td><strong>Reducing</strong></td> 
<td>The command for reducing spectra is <a href="sreduce.html">sreduce</a>.
It runs off an ASCII file in the same way that <a href="reduce.html">reduce</a>
does. See <a href="sreduce.sre">sreduce.sre</a> for an example.
</td></tr>  

<tr valign="top">
<td><strong>4</strong></td> <td><strong>Looking at the results</strong></td> 
<td>The spectra are dumped to a molly file, so it is useful to have molly
installed.
</td></tr>  

<tr valign="top">
<td><strong>5</strong></td> <td><strong>Measuring avalanche gain</strong></td> 
<td>L3CCDs with low count levels have either 0 or 1 electron per
pixel. The histogram of these gives a spike for all those with 0 electrons
plus an exponential distribution for the single electron pixels. This can be
fitted to give an estimate of the gain. I have made a crude script to do this
called <a href="l3gain.html">l3gain</a>.
</td></tr>  

<tr valign="top">
<td><strong>6</strong></td> <td><strong>Spectrograph setup</strong></td> 
<td>There are a few routines helpful in setting up spectrographs
with Hartmann shutter exposures of arcs. These are <a
href="collapse.html">collapse</a>, <a href="lplot.html">lplot</a>,
<a href="ppos.html">ppos</a> and possibly <a href="expand.html">expand</a>.
