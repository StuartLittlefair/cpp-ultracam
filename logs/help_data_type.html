<h1>ULTRACAM data types</h1>

<p>
The ULTRACAM comment form requires you to specify a "Data type". This is to be
taken in the sense that you have, for example, been looking at what is indicated
in the logs as a bias, but is in fact clearly a flat field, i.e. something is
wrong and you would like to correct it. The data type parameter allows you to 
flag up that is a flat and is intended in the end to feed back into the logs.

<p>
Here are the meanings of the possible types:

<p>
<table>

<tr>
<td class="bleft">Unspecified</td>
<td class="long">
Use this when you are <i>not</i> commenting on the specific nature of the data,
but noting something else. e.g. "Satellite passes across target on frame 38",
or "eclipse was 20 mins later than expected".
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td class="bleft">Junk</td>
<td class="long">The data of the run are junk and have no value at all. They can be 
deleted without regret. Ultimately, this is exactly what I will do, so be
  careful in applying this one.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="bleft">Good</td>
<td class="long">This is to indicate the data have been looked at and are basically OK.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="bleft">Reduced</td>
<td class="long">The data of the run have been reduced. In this case you will
  need to upload a copy of the reduced log file, which you should convert to a
  fits.gz file using 'ulog2fits' and gzip. The size of file you can upload is
  limited to 8MB.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="bleft">Acquisition</td>
<td class="long">The data represent a target acquisition.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="bleft">Bias</td>
<td class="long">The data are bias frames.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="bleft">Dark</td>
<td class="long">The data are dark frames. Dark frames are very close to bias frames. The
  main distinction is that dark frames have been allowed to accumulate counts.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="bleft">Science</td>
<td class="long">The data are science frames. (Includes standard star data.) </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="bleft">Flat</td>
<td class="long">The data are flat fields.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="bleft">Technical</td>
<td class="long">The data are useful for testing purposes: noise characteristics, linearity
etc.</td>
</tr>
