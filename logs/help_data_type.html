<h1>ULTRACAM data types</h1>

<p>
The ULTRACAM comment form requires you to specify a "Data type". This is to be
taken in the sense that you have, for example, been looking at what is indicated
in the logs as a bias, but is in fact clearly a flat field, i.e. something is
wrong and you would like to correct it. The data type parameter allows you to 
flag up that is a flat and is intended in the end to feed back into the logs.

<p>
Here are the meanings of the possible types:

<p>
<table>

<tr>
<td><b>Unspecified</b></td>
<td class="long">
Use this when you are <i>not</i> commenting on the specific nature of the data,
but noting something else. e.g. "Satellite passes across target on frame 38",
or "eclipse was 20 mins later than expected".
</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Junk</b></td>
<td class="long">The data of the run are junk and have no value at all. They can be 
deleted without regret. Ultimately, this is exactly what I will do, so be
  careful in applying this one.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>Good</b></td>
<td class="long">This is to indicate the data have been looked at and are basically OK.</td>
</tr>

<tr><td><b>Reduced</b></td>
<td class="long">The data of the run have been reduced. In this case try to specify a
  location of the reduced data in the comments.</td>
</tr>

<tr><td><b>Acquisition</b></td>
<td class="long">The data represent a target acquisition.</td>
</tr>


<tr><td><b>Bias</b></td>
<td class="long">The data are bias frames.</td>
</tr>

<tr><td><b>Dark</b></td>
<td class="long">The data are dark frames. Dark frames are very close to bias frames. The
  main distinction is that dark frames have been allowed to accumulate counts.
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td><b>Science</b></td>
<td class="long">The data are science frames. (Includes standard star data.) </td>
</tr>

<tr><td><b>Flat</b></td>
<td class="long">The data are flat fields.</td>
</tr>

<tr><td><b>Technical</b></td>
<td class="long">The data are useful for testing purposes: noise characteristics, linearity
etc.</td>
</tr>
</table>
