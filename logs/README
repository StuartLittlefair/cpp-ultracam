The log structure is a mix of html, js, css and php and thus is rather
complex. It is also designed to work for different cameras without unnecessary
repetition.

Basic structure is an index.php file which defines the basic log page
structure of a left-hand side guie, a title section and the table itself.
The content is loaded and controlled via javascript (ultra_guide.js). Before
it even gets to this point, asmall bit of php can control the initialisation
of the log which is displayed.
