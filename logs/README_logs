The ULTRACAM data logs are now quite complex so I thought it would be worth
detailing them and their construction.

The basic structure of the logs follows the night-by-night structure of the
data directories. See the README in /storage/astro2/phsaap/ULTRACAM

Once new data are ingested, the script 'make_times.py' creates data files
defining the start and end times of every run. Following this 'make_logs.py'
generates html log files. Each run is linked to the php script 'ucomment.php'
and through it to the Python script 'ucomment.py' to allow users to make
comments. In order to automatically capture the names of users, I have
introduced password access via htaccess, htpasswd. The comments are e-mailed
to me, and then can be collated into a FITS file 'ultracam_comment.fits' using
the script 'ucomment_proc.py'. 

Ultimately I expect to link 'ucomment.py' to the database file so that old
comments can be listed while making any new ones and also 'make_logs.py' 
(or possibly 'Ultra.py') so that data flags can be defined in the static logs.
