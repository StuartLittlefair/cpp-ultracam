<h1>ULTRACAM data logs</h1>

<p>
This pages contains all ULTRACAM data archive-related links. The ULTRACAM 
data logs come in two versions. One has everything you should
need, the other is somewhat truncated to make it easier to read and is designed
to contain what one usually looks for during reduction. There is also
a means for searching out runs on a given object, which can also be reached via
the full target list:

<ul>
<li><a href="index_full.html">Complete logs</a>: full information, long lines.
<li><a href="index_short.html">Truncated logs</a>: bulk of information needed
  during reduction.
<li><a href="ulogs.php">Interactive run search</a>: searches for runs matching 
specified positions.
<li><a href="all_targets.html">Complete list of targets</a>: list of all
  targets observed with ULTRACAM, including automatic links to the run searcher.
</ul>
