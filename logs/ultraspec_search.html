<h1>ULTRASPEC run search page.</h1>

<p>
This page allows position-based searches for through the ULTRASPEC
runs and also contains the complete list of objects we have observed with
ULTRASPEC. The searches return all runs which satisfy the selection criteria
below, which are currently based upon distance on the sky and exposure time.
You can either enter the position explicitly or click on one of the objects
in the target list. The search results are displayed in a new page.

<p>
<h3>Selection criteria:</h3>
<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td class="left">Maximum distance:<br>(degrees)</td>
<td class="left"><input type="number" id="dist" value="2" size=5></td>
<td class="left">Minimum exposure:<br>(minutes)</td>
<td class="left"><input type="number" id="expose" value="0" size=5></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>Search by position:</h2>

<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td class="left">Right Ascension:<br>(decimal hours)</td>
<td class="left"><input type="number" id="ra" value="0" size=5></td>
<td class="left">Declination:<br>(decimal degrees)</td>
<td class="left"><input type="number" id="dec" value="0" size=5></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>

<p><input type="button" id="search" value="Search"></p>

<p>
<h2>Search by target</h2>

<p>
The table below is a complete list of targets keyed on unique combinations of
ID and position. For each one, the list of strings are the target names as
entered at the telescope that have been translated to the given ID. If you spot
errors, let me know. The "~" character is interpreted as a blank when string
matching. Click the targets to carry out run searches on their positions. The
position used will be loaded into the RA and Dec fields above.
