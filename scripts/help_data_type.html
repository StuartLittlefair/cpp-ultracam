<h1>ULTRACAM data types</h1>

<p>
The ULTRACAM comment form allows you to specify a "data type". This is to be
taken in the sense thst you have for example been looking at what is indicated
in the logs as a bias, but is in fact clearly a flat field. This is a common
occurrence. The data type parameter allows you to flag up that is a flat. Here
are the implied meanings of the possible types:

<p>
<table>

<tr>
<td><b>Unspecified</b></td>
<td class="long">
Use this when you are not commenting on the specific nature of the data,
but noting something else. e.g. "Satellite passes across target on frame 38"
</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Junk</b></td>
<td class="long">The data of the run are junk and have no value at all. They can be 
deleted without regret (be conservative: a peppered flat for instance is no
  use as a flat but possibly interesting for understanding peppering. You might
want to label it 'technical' instead.)</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>Good</b></td>
<td class="long">This is to indicate the data have been looked at and are basically OK.</td>
</tr>

<tr><td><b>Reduced</b></td>
<td class="long">The data of the run have been reduced. In this case try to specify a
  location of the reduced data in the comments.</td>
</tr>

<tr><td><b>Acquisition</b></td>
<td class="long">The data represent target acquisition.</td>
</tr>


<tr><td><b>Bias</b></td>
<td class="long">The data are bias frames.</td>
</tr>

<tr><td><b>Dark</b></td>
<td class="long">The data are dark frames. Dark frames are very close to bias frames. The
  main distinction is that dark frames have been allowed to accumulate counts.
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td><b>Science</b></td>
<td class="long">The data are science frames. (Includes standard star data.) </td>
</tr>

<tr><td><b>Flat</b></td>
<td class="long">The data are flat fields.</td>
</tr>

<tr><td><b>Technical</b></td>
<td class="long">The data are useful for testing purposes: noise characteristics, linearity
etc.</td>
</tr>
</table>
