   regions. ***DONE

2) Profile fitting photometry. ***DONE

3) Java-based editor for the reduce file. 

4) Revise parseXML for non-deprecated Xerces stuff. ***DONE

5) Try to track down 'midnight bug' ***DONE

6) Program to help define position and rotator PA during setup.

7) Upgrade of 'rtplot' to warn of dodgy red bias. ***DONE but not terribly

10) Re-write to give cleaner interface with Array1D and especially Array2D
    within 'Windata'. May require a change to the 'ucm' format which can
    probably be flagged with a header item.

11) 10 is preparotory work to upgrade the source location algorithms to handle 
    much more difficult cases of rotations, scaling and translations via a
    'sextractor' type approach. I want this to work on individual Array2Ds for
    generality.
